# Apache Kafka 4.0.0 - KRaft Mode Cluster Setup with Real-world Use Case (Annuity Insurance)

## ðŸ“¦ Overview
Apache Kafka 4.0.0 is a distributed streaming platform used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It removes the dependency on ZooKeeper by using KRaft (Kafka Raft) mode for metadata management.

This document outlines:
- How to build a multi-broker Kafka 4.0.0 cluster
- Set up performance testing
- Monitor using Prometheus & Grafana
- Real-world use case in Annuity Insurance

- This repository provides a production-ready Kafka 4.0.0 (KRaft mode) multi-broker setup with real-world use cases tailored for the annuity insurance domain. It includes setup automation scripts, performance testing utilities, and monitoring integration with Prometheus and Grafana. The use case demonstrates how Kafkaâ€™s partitions, brokers, replication, and consumer groups work together to streamline real-time event processing for high-volume, fault-tolerant workloads such as policy events, fund allocations, and compliance tracking.
