ðŸŽ‰ Success! Your Apache Kafka 4.0 broker is now fully up and running in KRaft mode (ZooKeeper-free). The logs confirm that:

The broker has successfully transitioned from STARTING â†’ RECOVERY â†’ RUNNING â†’ STARTED.

Listeners are active on:
    localhost:9092 (PLAINTEXT for Kafka clients)
    localhost:9093 (CONTROLLER listener for internal KRaft coordination)

Kafka has registered and initialized internal components like group coordinator, transaction coordinator,
log cleaner, etc.

It's using log.dirs = /tmp/kraft-combined-logs, confirming your KRaft setup.
